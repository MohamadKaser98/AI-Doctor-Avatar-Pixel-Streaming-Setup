# AI Doctor Project

One of my Masterâ€™s degree projects is an **AI Doctor** project, which is a machine learning model that interacts with patients. This project has been implemented using **Unreal Engine**, **Python**, and **React**.

## Challenges
One of the challenges we faced was how to set up the pixel stream, which primarily involved streaming the avatar to a web application.

## Documentation
Here you can check the pdf uploaded on this repository to know how it works.
